Welcome to my website. I've just set this up to hold my porfolio, but I plan on including blog posts and articles about what I am working on.
This website is built in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I'm still learning markdown, and how to combine it with custom hugo html, so my future posts should be less barebones.
