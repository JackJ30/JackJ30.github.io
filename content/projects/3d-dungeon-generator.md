This program generates 3D dungeons in seconds. It feature **completely** randomly generated rooms instead of stringing together pre-made rooms. The video above features the room cluster system, but it can also connect rooms using hallways. It was made using [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) and C#. I based my technique off of [this](https://vazgriz.com/119/procedurally-generated-dungeons/) article, and improved it with more advanced pathfinding, optimization, and techniques for room generation.
